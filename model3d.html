                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                  The use of graphics libraries to engage and motivate students in
                  learning introductory programming has consistently shown to be
                  useful. In the early days of CS education, Logo Turtle, which was

                  used in over 250 classrooms, was found to have dramatic improvements in student engagement, confidence, problem-solving abilities, and motivation, among others. Since then, a variety of

                  newer tools have been found effective.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                For example, the Processing Project was created with the aim to facilitate

                an exploratory and design-oriented approach to teaching programming. The Processing programming language is based on Java and

                provides a flexible set of code elements to create visual designs in
                both two and three dimensions. Processing-based CS education programs report
                great success in improving student interest and retention through
                this approach, which they studied across two universities over six
                years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A similar approach has also been extended to physical models. Processing-based libraries for creating designs to be forged by a laser cutter, for example, have also been successful, finding that almost all participants in workshops using them are interested in programming again in the future.
                </p><br><p>

                The present project can be seen as a further conceptual expansion
                of this approach, in that it provides a library
                for modelling designs for digital fabrication, but for 3D digital
                fabrication machines, i.e. 3D printers.

                <h4>System Design</h4>
                <p>

                  This project focuses on the design component of the 3D printing workflow. <br>
                  The core Model3D application provides a typical IDE with a text editor and the ability to run
                  the implemented code. The viewer renders the code on-screen as a
                  3D visualisation of the model. This interface is shown below.<br>
                </p>

                <img src="./assets/images/example_task_spheres.PNG" style="margin:50px 50px">

                <p>A user implements writes code that specifies a 3D artefact. The
                  client sends this javascript file to a web server which runs the
                  implemented code with the OpenJsCad backend. The server returns
                  a graphical representation of the artefact to be rendered in the
                  user interface.</p><br>


                  <p>When happy with their model, they can move to the Print3D printing
                  simulation, or export the model to a format commonly used in computer-aided design, STL (STereoLithography).
                This format is accepted by most modern printers, and is also what is used for compilation by
                the simulation.</p>

                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>The results collected from our study were found to support our
                  hypotheses, which says that educators will find Model3D to be
                  user-friendly for novices, and useful for increasing student motivation in learning introductory programming. This was supported by
                  the quantitative surveys, which found significantly above average
                  positive attitudes both in terms of usability and utility towards motivation. The qualitative data also supports the hypotheses, where
                  participants express concerns about particular aspects, but on the
                  whole find the system user-friendly, interesting, and useful for
                  teaching.</p><br>
                <p>
                  The distribution of scores can be seen below, for usability:

                    <p>"It gives a very clear visualisation of the code, and with
                      the code and result on the same screen, it is easy to
                      see the result of small changes to the code and figure
                      out how things work.."</p>

                    <p>"While I have given a fair amount of feedback I do
                      feel like the project is a great success. I felt really
                      motivated to continue experimenting after trying the
                      tool. The suggestions I have given are aimed at making
                      it more easier to use in an educational setting where
                      users should spend as little time as possible figuring
                      out the tools they use (as that is not the focus of their
                      work)."</p>
