            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              3D printing is an exciting and innovative technology, and Educators 
              are becoming more aware of its potential in STEAM education.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The use of 3D printings in introductory programming to engage 
              and motivate students is a fairly new idea and has mainly been used for 
              blind and visually impaired students.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              By bridging programming and 3D printing, students have the possibility 
              to explore emerging technologies like 3D printing, 
              which is a very promising and exciting technology for 
              both industry and education.
            </p> <br><p>
              However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, using a 3D
              printer was substituted using a 3D printing simulation
              </p> <p>
              It was argued that this is still has potential to be a
              viable way to get students excited about programming, as it gives them
              the thought that their skills and knowledge can produce tangible products,
              as well as introduce them to the innovative world of 3D printing

            <h4>System Design</h4>
            <p>

              This project focuses on the design component of the 3D printing workflow. <br>

              A 3D printer simulator was developed that allows users to interact with and view the virtual
              printing of their own artefact.
              
              The core Print3D application provides a simulation window and controls to control the simulation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>A 3D model is received in the form of a STL (Standard Tessellation Language) file, 
              a format native to CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. However, a 3D printer
              needs an algorithm to move it’s tip and extrude filament
              around a 3D space. Gcode is the language that specifies
              these movements. An STL file can be ‘sliced’/converted
              into a Gcode file via Slic3r, a slicing software. The Gcode is visualized with Three.js, a JavaScript
              library used to create animated 3D computer graphics in
              a web browser. Since a Gcode file is essentially a list of
              3D points that a 3D printer follows, a program was developed in JavaScript, using Three.js, that controls the drawing of lines between these
              points. This interface is shown below.<br> </p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The results indicate that educators consideration towards the 3D printing simulation as a motivating tool
              to learning introductory programming was high from our motivation survey, with an overall score of 4.458
              (max of 5). The results also indicate the educators level of agreement to the system being usable was high from our
              usability survey, with an overall score of 5.838 (max of 7). 
</p><br>
            <p>
              The distribution of scores can be seen below, for usability:

                <p>"I think this tool would be perfect for university students who want to get into 3D printing. 
                  Python support would make it easier to get into at earlier stages of university.

                <p>"Overall, I really enjoyed using the system and felt motivated to experiment with new ideas for 3D Prints. 
                  The immediate feedback loop is something I really appreciated and I feel like this really fits in with the
                   quick iteration philosophy of 3D printing."</p>
