                    <h2>Research <em>Methodology</em></h2>
                    <p>An investigation was set out to gain an understanding
                      on how the combination of 3D printing simulation and
                      programming using graphics libraries can contribute to
                      computing education and more specifically motivating
                      the learning of programming.</p>
                    <p>Our data collected consisted of:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Qualitative observations about system usage made during
                      user testing sessions</li>
                      <li>Quantitative surveys regarding system usability and motivation</li>
                    <li>An open-ended "general feedback" question added to the
                      surveys (qualitative)</li>
                      <li>Semi-structured interviews to discuss in greater depth participants’ experiences and background</li>
                    </ol>
<br>
                    <h5>Participants</h5>
                    <p>All participants were staff members from the Computer Science
                      department at the University of Cape Town, recruited using the
                      purposive sampling method through our supervisor, Gary Stewart.
                      This means that participants are selected on the basis of the experience and knowledge they possess, which is an efficient method
                      for collecting expert data. The inclusion criteria for participants were that they should have some experience with teaching
                      introductory programming in a university context.</p>
                    <p>We contacted 7 qualifying staff members via email with an invitation to participate – 2 first-year computer science lecturers, 4
                      teaching assistants, and a scientific officer who assists in running
                      the courses. The 2 lecturers were unavailable; thus, the study consisted of the remaining 5 participants.</p>

                    <h5>Materials/Measures</h5><br>
                    <h6>Usability</h6>
                    <p>The <em>PSSUQ (Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire)</em> is a 17-item standardized questionnaire. It is
                      widely used to measure a user’s perceived satisfaction
                      of a website, software, system or product at the end of
                      a study. The questionnaire allowed users to rate the 17
                      statements using a 7-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree up to 7=strongly agree).</p>

                    <h6>Motivation</h6>
                    <p>Instructor attitudes towards the system as a tool for
                      teaching will be assessed using the <em>M-SERI (Modified Survey About Educational Robotics for Instruction)</em>, an 18-item questionnaire with 5-point Likert scale
                      (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=not sure, 4=agree,
                      5=strongly agree). The original survey was modified
                      slightly by interchanging “educational robots” with “3D
                      printing” and altered some questions to concentrate on
                      utility towards motivation.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Procedure</h5>
                    <p>Evaluation was done in two stages: (i) an initial pilot study, which
                      provided feedback and suggestions for the system, and (ii) a final
                      assessment to evaluate the improved system once suggestions had
                      been implemented. The overall structure followed for both stages
                      was similar. Participants booked a timeslot online for an individual
                      video call testing session. They were then sent an agenda for the
                      session, and instructions for setting up the web-app on their computers in preparation. Once the session had concluded, they were
                      sent links to the two surveys to complete. The procedures followed
                      during a session for each stage are detailed below.</p>

                    <h6>Initial round</h6>
                    <p>Users were introduced to the project’s aim and research
                      questions, and to the system. An example task, using
                      the system, was done to further explain the 3D modeling
                      library and printing controls. All of this was done in the
                      first 10 minutes. With this knowledge, the participant
                      were shown two pre-made artefacts and they attempted
                      to develop algorithms and use built-in functions, and
                      then print these examples. The algorithms included for
                      loops, arrays, variables and functions.
                      Enough information was left out in our introduction
                      such that the users have to think for themselves and use
                      the system independently.</p>
                    <p>These tasks are shown below:</p>
                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-md-6"><img src="./assets/images/cubegrid.png" alt="" height="300"></div>
                      <div class="col-md-6"><img src="assets/images/spiral-pyramid.png" alt="" height="300"> </div>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    <h6>Final Assessment</h6>
                    <p>As users were already familiar with the
                      project and basic interface at this stage, we only provided an overview
                      of the changes from the previous version as an introduction. Similarly to the pilot study, participants were then asked to recreate
                      a provided model:</p>
                    <img src="assets/images/cube-triangle.png" alt=""><br><br>
                    <p>This was the user task for the final round. This
                      time scaffolded code was provided as this is a way to
                      show users that you can create custom shapes and not
                      just primitive standard shapes provided by OpenJSCAD.</p>

                    <p>Once the tasks were complete, we commenced a semi-structured
                      interview. The questions sought to gather information around the
                      following main categories:</p>

                      <ol>

                        <li>Participant background and context</li>
                        <li>Experience of and feedback regarding the system</li>
                        <li>Perceptions of relevant concepts before and after engaging with the system</li>
                        <li>Expectations of student experiences using the system</li>
                  </ol>

                    <p>For the results, check back on the <a href="index.html#results">main page</a>,
